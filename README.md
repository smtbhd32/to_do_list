# todo
You may be wondering why I named this project "Vision". So, what do we mean by "Vision"? Vision is the ability to think about or plan the future with imagination or wisdom.
And that's what we do while we add tasks to our ToDo List,i.e. we plan our future with imagination.

Project Vision is made on the theme of the to-do list, consisting single-page dynamic website which uses local storage for its data storage.
Works on live gradient background :) Dynamic to-do-list :) Can add new entries :) Can delete old entries :) Remembers old enries and their status :) Uses local storage for storing user data :) Option for resetting to-do-list :) Uses local storage for storing user data :) Have a live clock :) 

--> I am assigned with this project in 2nd round of UCC&DA auditions. It's a society in Ymca, Faridabad.
